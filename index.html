                    <h2>Aim and Scope</h2>
                    <p>The last two decades have witnessed an extremely fast evolution of network technologies and an steep growth in mobile data traffic. According to the latest edition of the Cisco Visual Networking Index (VNI), global mobile data traffic is projected to increase nearly three-fold from 2020 to 2025, reaching 184 exabytes per month by 2025. This growth is being fuelled by factors such as the proliferation of mobile devices, the increasing availability of high-speed mobile networks, and the growing adoption of data-intensive mobile applications. This trend is coming along with increased capabilities and intelligence of devices, hence offering great opportunities for research innovation and development.
                    </p>

                    <p>Globally, 5G network deployments are becoming generalized, providing higher data speeds at low latency and enhanced throughput to handle more simultaneous connections without causing disruptions when compared with previous mobile generation. However, some issues and challenges have not been fully addressed in 5G mobile networks and they are attracting further research efforts like the emerging applications challenges that are pushing the required quality of service to extreme levels, the mobile edge computing issues for user mobility support in small cells, the tendency towards Open and smart RAN enabling interoperable interfaces, RAN virtualization and push embedded machine learning systems and artificial intelligence back end modules for an enhanced RAN intelligence. These challenges drive the need towards deep research on the next generation of mobile Internet system, the 6G, that would tackle these challenges while deliver new mobile services and defining the fundamental architectural components for the next generation mobile Internet.
                    </p>

                    <p>ACM MobiArch 2023 will continue to serve as a forum for discussing recent research trends and future directions gathered 
                        around all aspects of mobile communication technologies and mobile Internet architectures, such as system and radio access 
                        challenges that have to be faced to implement reliable, optimized, and scalable mobile networked systems. </p>
